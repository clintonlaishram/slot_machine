# slot_machine

# This slot machine project is a Python program that simulates the functionality of a simple slot machine game. 
# It allows users to deposit an initial balance and play rounds of the slot machine until they decide to quit. 
# Here's an overview of the project's key components and functionalities:

# Initialization Constants:
   - `MAX_LINES`: Maximum number of lines a player can bet on.
   - `MAX_BET`: Maximum amount a player can bet on each line.
   - `MIN_BET`: Minimum amount a player can bet on each line.
   - `ROWS`: Number of rows in the slot machine display.
   - `COLS`: Number of columns in the slot machine display.
   
# Symbol Definitions:
   - `symbol_count`: A dictionary that defines the count of each symbol available in the game.
   - `symbol_value`: A dictionary that assigns a value to each symbol used for calculating winnings.

# `check_winnings` Function:
   - Determines the player's winnings based on the symbols that align in a row across the columns.
   - Calculates the total winnings and identifies the lines where winning combinations occur.

# `get_slot_machine_spin` Function:
   - Generates a random configuration of symbols for each column of the slot machine display.
   - The configuration is created based on the symbol counts defined in the `symbol_count` dictionary.

# `print_slot_machine` Function:
   - Prints the current configuration of the slot machine's display, showing the symbols in each column.

# User Interaction Functions:
   - `deposit`: Allows the player to deposit an initial amount of money.
   - `get_number_of_lines`: Takes input for the number of lines the player wants to bet on.
   - `get_bet`: Takes input for the bet amount the player wants to place on each line.
   - `spin`: Handles the spinning of the slot machine and calculates winnings and deductions from the player's balance.

# Main Execution:
   - The program first prompts the player to deposit an initial balance.
   - Inside the main loop, the player can choose to play a round or quit the game.
   - After each round, the player's balance is updated based on the outcome of the spin.
   - The loop continues until the player decides to quit.

# Outcome Display:
   - The program displays the current balance before each round.
   - After each round, it shows the symbols spun, the calculated winnings, and the lines where winning combinations occurred.
   - The balance is updated based on the net result of the round.

# Exiting the Game:
   - The player can choose to quit the game at any point by pressing "q".
   - After exiting the game loop, the final balance is displayed.

# The program simulates the process of betting on a slot machine with predefined symbols and rules, 
# giving players a sense of winning and losing based on random outcomes. 
# The player's goal is to accumulate more money by strategically placing bets on 
# multiple lines to match winning symbol combinations.
